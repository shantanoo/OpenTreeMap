Input file fields:
	
	ID		 - original tree identifier, stored as text
	POINT_X		 - EPSG:4326
	POINT_Y		 - EPSG:4326
	*GENUS		 - text, case sensitive
	*SPECIES	 - text, case sensitive
	*CULTIVAR	 - text, no quotation marks, case sensitive
	*GENDER  	 - text, case sensitive 
	+ADDRESS	 - Geocodable street address
	PLOTTYPE	 - one of the db plot choices, case sensitive
	PLOTLENGTH	 - number, feet
	PLOTWIDTH	 - number, feet
	POWERLINE	 - True/False
	OWNER		 - property or tree owner name, not a site user
	STEWARD		 - steward name, not a site user
	SPONSOR		 - sponsor organization or individual
	DATEPLANTED	 - postgres-recognizable date format
	DIAMETER	 - number, inches
	HEIGHT		 - number, feet
	CANOPYHEIGHT	 - number, feet
	CONDITION	 - one of the db condition choices, case sensitive
	CANOPYCONDITION	 - one of the db canopy condition choices, case sensitive

	PROJECT2	 - text, one of db special project names, case sensitive
	PROJECT3	 - text, one of db special project names, case sensitive
	

* If the species table only identifies genus and species, but NOT cultivar
or gender, then in the tree record input the two fields may be combined into a
single field labeled SCIENTIFIC, formatted as "Genus species".  Whichever format
is used, the fields must match (except for case) the corresponding fields
(genus,species,cultivar,gender or scientific_name) in the species table.

+ ADDRESS, the street address like '26 Bailey Ave'. The city, zip and
neighborhood are auto generated. The state portion of address is hard-coded
in uimport.py as 'CA', change as desired. Only the street-address is seemingly
used at present.

The ID is saved in plot.owner_orig_id separate from the newly-assigned plot and
tree id's.  Additional fields, ORIGID, OWNER_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES,
OWNER_ADDITIONAL_ID, may also be imported from the spreadsheet if needed for
special purposes. See the uimport.py code for details. None of these fields is
displayed in the user interface.

Output file:
If any row has unrecoverable errors, the row is written to
<input_file_name>.err as a csv:
		- missing or 0,0 coordinates
		- species not found in db
